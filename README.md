# Running the project

To run the project, ensure you have the following directory structure. Other folders used for previous HW assignments may be present but will not impact running the code.

```
.
|   README.md
|   requirements.txt
|   .gitignore
|
└───code
|   |   main.py
|   |   get_data.py
|   |   analyze.py
|   |   make_visuals.py
|
└───data
|   └───5-core
|       |   ...
|   └───ratings
|       |   ...
|
└───result
|   |   ...
|
|   ...

```

The contents of `data` and `result` will depend on which datasets you have downloaded. For the purposes of this demonstration I have provided the `Appliances` and `Magazine Subscriptions` datasets. Once you have verified that you have the proper directory structure, run
```
python code/main.py
```
